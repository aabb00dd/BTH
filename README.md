# University Projects Repository

This repository contains a collection of my **university projects** completed during my academic studies. It serves as a centralized portfolio showcasing work from different courses, topics, and technical domains.

The projects demonstrate both **theoretical knowledge** and **practical implementation**, ranging from small assignments to larger, more comprehensive course projects.

## Purpose of This Repository

The main objectives of this repository are to:

- Organize all university-related projects in one place  
- Showcase academic progress and technical skill development  
- Serve as a reference for learning and future improvement  
- Provide transparency for reviewers, collaborators, and recruiters  

Each project was completed as part of formal university coursework.
