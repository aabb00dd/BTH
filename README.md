# University Projects Collection

This repository contains my university (school) projects, organized by primary programming language.  
Each top-level folder represents the main language used in the projects inside it, and each language folder contains multiple individual projects.

## About the Repository

The purpose of this repository is to collect and document coursework projects across different subjects and technologies, and to show my progress in software development through practical assignments.

These projects may cover areas such as web development, data analysis, AI/ML, algorithms and data structures, software testing, databases, and backend development.

## Repository Structure

- Each top-level folder = a programming language (the primary language used in those projects)
- Inside each language folder = individual project folders
- Many projects include their own `README.md` with setup and usage instructions

Example structure:

    .
    ├── Python/
    │   ├── project_1/
    │   ├── project_2/
    │   └── ...
    ├── JavaScript/
    │   ├── project_1/
    │   ├── project_2/
    │   └── ...
    ├── Java/
    │   ├── project_1/
    │   ├── project_2/
    │   └── ...
    ├── SQL/
    │   ├── project_1/
    │   └── ...
    └── ...

## Notes

Some projects were completed individually, while others were developed in teams depending on the course.  
Structure and tooling may vary between projects because course requirements differ.

This repository is continuously updated as new coursework projects are completed.

## Academic Integrity

This repository is shared for educational and portfolio purposes only.  
Do not copy or submit any part of these projects as your own coursework.
