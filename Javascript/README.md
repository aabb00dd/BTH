# BTH Health Website (JavaScript School Project)

This repository contains the **BTH Health Website**, a JavaScript-based project developed as part of my coursework at **Blekinge Institute of Technology (BTH)**. The project focuses on applying modern web development practices and building a structured website/application with a clear, maintainable codebase.

## About the Project

The purpose of this project was to explore and apply key concepts in web development, including:

- Building a functional website using **JavaScript (ES6+)** and modern project structure
- Designing a user-friendly interface with responsive layout principles
- Organizing reusable components and separating concerns for clean, maintainable code
- Working with routing and page/section structure (if applicable)
- Handling user interaction, form input, and basic validation (if applicable)
- Managing dependencies and scripts with **Node.js** and **npm**
- Using Git and GitHub for version control, collaboration, and structured development workflow

The project is intended for **educational purposes** and demonstrates practical experience in frontend development, project organization, and software engineering principles using JavaScript.
