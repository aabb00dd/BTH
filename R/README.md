# R Statistical Modeling Projects

This repository contains R projects developed as part of coursework in time series analysis and statistical modeling.

## About the Project

The purpose of these R projects was to explore and apply core concepts in time series forecasting and model evaluation, including:

- Modeling time series data using AR, ARMA, SARMA, and SARIMA models
- Conducting statistical tests such as ADF, Ljung-Box, and ARCH for model diagnostics
- Using Box-Cox transformation to stabilize variance and improve model fit
- Decomposing time series into trend, seasonal, and residual components
- Evaluating models using metrics like AIC, BIC, RMSE, MAPE, and MASE
- Applying theoretical knowledge through practical, script-based simulations in R

This work provides hands-on experience with time-dependent data, model development, and forecasting accuracy evaluation using R's rich statistical libraries.
